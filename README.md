Golang project


Building an entire blockchain with wallets, UTXO persistence layer, Merkle tree, and a decentralized peer-to-peer network
such Miners who run the proof of work algorithm to mine blocks and run the networks, fullNodes who take validated blocks and
verify transactions (copy of blockchain in the node) and Simplified payment verification nodes that are wallets that utilize 
Merkle trees to send and receive transaction, thus capable of verifying their own transactions.
